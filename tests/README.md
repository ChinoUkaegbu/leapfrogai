# Testing

This document outlines tests related to the LeapfrogAI API and backends.

Please see the [documentation in the LeapfrogAI UI sub-directory](../src/leapfrogai_ui/README.md) for Svelte UI Playwright tests.

## API

For the unit and integration tests within this directory, the following components must be running and accessible:

- [LeapfrogAI API](../src/leapfrogai_api/README.md)
- [Repeater](../packages/repeater/README.md)
- [Supabase](../packages/supabase/README.md)

If you are running everything in a [UDS Kubernetes cluster](../k3d-gpu/README.md), you must port-forward your model (e.g., Repeater, vLLM, etc.) using the following command:

```bash
# may be named repeater OR repeater-model depending on the rendered Helm manifests
uds zarf connect --name=repeater-model --namespace=leapfrogai --local-port=50051 --remote-port=50051
```

If running everything via Docker containers or in a local Python environment, then ensure they are accessible based on the test configurations in each testing target's sub-directory.

Please see the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more details on turning tests on/off and for setting test parameters like the default model to use. Below is a quick synopsis of the available Make targets that are **run from the root of the entire repository**:

```bash
# Install the python dependencies
make install

# create a test user for the tests
# prompts for a password and email
make test-user

# setup the environment variables for the tests
# prompts for the previous step's password and email
make test-env

# run the unit tests
make test-api-unit

# run the integration tests
# choices: vllm or llama-cpp-python
LEAPFROGAI_MODEL=vllm make test-api-integration
# OR
LEAPFROGAI_MODEL=llama-cpp-python make test-api-integration
```

## Load Tests

Please see the [Load Test documentation](./load/README.md) and directory for more details.

## End-To-End Tests

End-to-End (E2E) tests are located in the `e2e/` sub-directory. Each E2E test runs independently based on the model backend that is to be tested.

The E2E tests run in CI pipelines, with the exception of vLLM, which requires a GPU runner.

For the E2E tests, the following components must be running and accessible in a [UDS Kubernetes cluster](../k3d-gpu/README.md):

- [LeapfrogAI API](../src/leapfrogai_api/README.md)
- [Supabase](../packages/supabase/README.md)
- Package to be tested (e.g., [vLLM](../packages/vllm/))

An example of running the vLLM E2E tests locally is as follows:

```bash
# Install the python dependencies
make install

# create a test user for the tests
# prompts for a password and email
make test-user

# setup the environment variables for the tests
# prompts for the previous step's password and email
make test-env

# run the e2e tests associated with a package
# below is a non-exhaustive list of example test runs
env $(cat .env | xargs) python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_api.py -vvv
env $(cat .env | xargs) LEAPFROGAI_MODEL=vllm python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_llm_generation.py -vvv
```

### Running Tests

Run the tests on an existing [UDS Kubernetes cluster](../k3d-gpu/README.md) with the applicable backend deployed to the cluster.

For example, the following sequence of commands runs test on the llama-cpp-python backend:

```bash
# Build and Deploy the LFAI API
make build-api
uds zarf package deploy packages/api/zarf-package-leapfrogai-api-*.tar.zst

# Build and Deploy the model backend you want to test.
# NOTE: In this case we are showing llama-cpp-python
make build-llama-cpp-python
uds zarf package deploy packages/llama-cpp-python/zarf-package-llama-cpp-python-*.tar.zst

# Install the python dependencies
python -m pip install ".[dev]"

# Run the tests!
# NOTE: Each model backend has its own e2e test files
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_llama.py -v

# Cleanup after yourself
k3d cluster delete uds
```
